Moving from another provider? We'll migrate your server for free.

Want us to do it? Complete step 1 below, then [contact us](https://berrybyte.net/contact). We'll handle the rest.

## How to Migrate

### 1. Zip Your Server Files

At your current provider, select all server files and zip them up.

### 2. Upload the Archive

Download the zip file to your computer, then upload it to the **Files** tab in your berrybyte game panel.

File too large? [Use SFTP](./panel/importing-files) instead.

### 3. Unpack and Configure

1. Delete any existing files in the panel
2. Click the three dots on your zip file and select **Unarchive**
3. Make sure your server settings match what you're importing (e.g., Forge, Fabric, Paper for Minecraft)
4. Update settings in the **Startup** tab if needed

### 4. Start Your Server

Once everything is set up, start your server. If it doesn't start, [contact support](https://berrybyte.net/contact).
