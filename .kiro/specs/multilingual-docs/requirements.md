# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds multilingual support to berrybyte's Mintlify documentation site (docs.berrybyte.net), supporting German (`de`) and Spanish (`es`) alongside the existing English content. The implementation must preserve all existing English content and URLs while introducing localized experiences with natural translations, localized slugs, and proper cross-referencing. The rollout will be incremental, allowing safe deployment one category at a time without breaking builds or creating 404s.
