Check your email for the "Account Created" message. Click the login link to open your game panel.

Your panel lets you:
- Start, stop, and restart your server

<Warning>
Server stuck on pending? It usually activates within 10 minutes. If not, [contact support](https://berrybyte.net/contact).
</Warning>

## Step 4: Start and Connect

1. In your panel, click **Start** to turn on your server
2. Wait 1-3 minutes for it to start up
3. Copy your server IP address from the panel
4. In your game, use "Direct Connect" or "Add Server" and paste the IP
