Create backups to protect your server data. We also take daily off-site backups automatically.

## Creating Backups

Go to the **Backups** tab in your game panel and click **Create Backup**.

</Frame>

- **Backup name**: Give it a name, or leave it empty for an automatic timestamp
- **Ignored Files & Directories**: List files/folders to skip (e.g., `/plugins/Dynmap/*`)
- **Locked**: Lock the backup to prevent accidental deletion

## Deleting Backups

Backup slots: Basic (3), Minecraft+ (8), Minecraft Elder (10). 

To delete a backup, click the three dots and select **Delete**. Confirm when prompted.

<Warning>Deleted backups **CANNOT** be recovered.</Warning>

## Restoring Backups

Click the three dots on the backup you want to restore. Choose whether to delete all files before restoring.

**Tip:** Create a backup of your current server before restoring, just in case.

## Mounting Backups

Need to restore just a few files? Mount a backup as a folder to pick and choose what to restore.

<Warning>
  You can't use power controls while a backup is mounted. Unmount it first.
</Warning>

**To mount:** Click the three dots on a backup and select mount. It will appear as a folder in your file manager.

<Frame>

**To restore files:** Open the mounted folder, select files, then click **Restore** (restores to original location) or **Move** (restores to a different path).

## Off-Site Backups

We automatically back up your server to off-site servers every 24 hours (kept for 14 days).

To restore an off-site backup, [create a ticket](https://berrybyte.net/ticket) with:
- Your server ID (Settings → Debug Information)
- Your email address
- The backup date you want restored

<Warning>
  Create a backup of your current server before we restore, as rollbacks aren't possible.
