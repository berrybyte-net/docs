Supported formats: `.zip`, `.7z`, `.tar.gz`

Enter your old server's SFTP/FTP/FTPS credentials. Leave the base directory as default, or specify a folder (e.g., `/plugins`) to import only that folder.

Click **Import Files** to start the transfer.

## SFTP Upload

<Info>No size limit. Recommended for large files.</Info>

1. Download an SFTP client: [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/index.php) (recommended) or [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org)
2. Go to **Settings** and click **Launch SFTP**
3. Enter your panel password when prompted
4. Drag-and-drop files from your computer into the SFTP client

**Slow transfer?** Transferring many small files is slower than one large file. Zip your files first, then [unarchive](/panel/unarchiving) them on the panel.

## Download from URL

<Info>No size limit.</Info>

Download files directly from a URL into your panel. Great for plugins, resource packs, or server JARs.

1. Go to **File Manager** and click **Download from URL**
2. Enter the file URL, filename, and destination folder
3. Click **Download**
