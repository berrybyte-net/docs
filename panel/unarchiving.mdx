# How to Extract Archives on Your Game Server

Extracting archives is a common task when managing game servers, whether you're installing modpacks, uploading plugins, or transferring server files. This guide covers the unarchiving process for ZIP, 7Z, and TAR.GZ files on your BerryByte game server.

## Supported Archive Formats

The file manager supports extracting the following archive types:
- `.zip` files
- `.7z` files  
- `.tar.gz` files

## How to Extract Archives

1. **Upload your archive** to the file manager using any of the [file upload methods](/panel/importing-files)
2. **Locate the archive** in your file manager
3. **Right-click the archive** or click the three dots menu
4. **Select "Unarchive"** from the dropdown menu
5. **Wait for extraction** - the files will be extracted to the current directory

## Common Use Cases

**Installing Modpacks**
- Upload modpack server files as a ZIP archive

**Adding Plugins**

- Maintain proper folder structure during extraction

**Server Migrations**
- Extract full server backups from previous hosts
- Preserve file permissions and directory structure

## Common Issues

- **Archive appears corrupted**: Re-upload the file, ensuring complete transfer
  - **Solution**: Download the archive again from the source and re-upload

- **Files extract to wrong location**: Archive may contain nested folders
  - **Solution**: Navigate into extracted folders and move files to correct locations

- **Unarchive option not available**: File may not be a supported archive format
  - **Solution**: Verify the file extension and format compatibility
