  We've rebuilt the website from the ground up with a gaming-focused aesthetic that feels familiar and welcoming. It's faster, easier to navigate, and maintains a consistent, polished design throughout.

  Designed and developed by our sister company [LUSORY™](https://lusory.studio).

  ### Dedicated Servers

  After months of private beta testing, we're opening up bare metal dedicated servers to everyone. Three models available, all powered by top-tier Ryzen 9 CPUs and Gen 4 NVMe SSDs. Launching in **Dallas, Texas** and **Seattle, Washington** with competitive pricing perfect for large communities and networks.

  Every server includes our terabit-scale DDoS protection at no extra cost. Managed game panels and BGP sessions are available as addons if you need them.

  ### More Games

  We've been investing heavily in our infrastructure, expanding our server fleet and global presence. This means we can handle more demand and continuously add support for new games — expect new additions every week.

  As a nice touch, the search bar on [/games](https://berrybyte.net/games) now recognizes common game aliases. Try searching "mc" for Minecraft or "7DTD" for 7 Days to Die.
