# How to Use Admin Commands on Your CS2 Server

## Accessing Admin Commands

1. Join your [CS2 server](https://berrybyte.net/cs2-server-hosting)
2. Press **~** to open console
3. Type admin commands (you need admin privileges)

## Basic Admin Commands

### Player Management
- `kick [player]` - Kick player from server
- `ban [player] [minutes]` - Ban player temporarily
- `banid [minutes] [steamid]` - Ban by Steam ID

### Server Management
- `changelevel [mapname]` - Change map
- `restart` - Restart current round
- `mp_restartgame 1` - Restart match

### Game Settings
- `mp_roundtime 2` - Set round time (minutes)
- `mp_maxrounds 30` - Set max rounds
- `mp_timelimit 0` - Set time limit (0 = no limit)

## Getting Admin Access

### Method 1: RCON
1. Login to the [game control panel](https://game.berrybyte.net)
2. Find RCON password in server settings
3. In CS2 console, type: `rcon_password [password]`
4. Use commands with `rcon` prefix: `rcon kick player`

### Method 2: Admin Plugin
1. Install admin plugin (like SourceMod)
2. Add your Steam ID to admin list
3. Use commands directly without rcon prefix

## Useful Server Commands

- `status` - Show connected players
- `maps *` - List available maps  
- `exec [config]` - Execute config file
- `say [message]` - Send message to all players

## Common Issues

**Commands not working**: Check you have admin privileges

**RCON authentication failed**: Verify RCON password is correct
