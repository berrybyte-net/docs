Every time [Qooland Games](https://mask.qoolandgames.com/), the creators behind the game Soulmask, releases patches, bug fixes, and new features for the game, you'll need to update the servers as well. If the server or game isn't updated, you may encounter the `The match you are trying to join is running an incompatible version of the game. Please try upgrading your game version.` error.
