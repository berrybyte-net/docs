# How to Install Modpacks on Your Minecraft Server

Install modpacks to add hundreds of mods working together on your server.

## Automatic Installation

1. Go to the **Modpacks** tab
2. Search for the modpack you want
3. Click **Install** next to your chosen modpack
4. The modpack will install automatically with the correct Forge version

## Manual Installation

If your modpack isn't in the automatic installer:

1. **Upload the modpack:**
   - Download the server archive (`.zip`) from [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com) or [CurseForge](https://curseforge.com)
   - [Upload it](/panel/importing-files) to your file manager

2. **Install Forge:**
   - Find the required Forge version in the modpack's readme (e.g., `43.2.14`)
   - Go to **Startup** tab and enter the version (e.g., `1.19.1-43.2.14`)
   - Delete all files **except** the modpack archive
   - Go to **Settings** tab and click **Reinstall**

3. **Unpack the modpack:**
   - Start the server once to generate files
   - Click the three dots next to the archive and click **Unarchive**
   - Start the server again

<Note>First startup with a modpack can take longer than usual.</Note>

## FAQ

<Accordion title="Archive unpacks a folder instead of files">
1. Go into the unarchived folder and select all files
2. Click the three dots and click **Archive**
3. Move the archive up one folder (click **Move** and add `../` before the filename)
4. Click **Unarchive** to extract files to the main folder
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="No unarchive button appears">
The archive may be corrupted. Re-upload it or download it again from the modpack site.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I upload my own custom modpack?">
Follow the same steps but upload your own archive. Package it with mod files and any custom configuration files.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="No Forge version specified">
Leave the **Forge Version** field empty. Instead, enter the Minecraft version (e.g., `1.16.5`) in the **Minecraft Version** field to install the latest recommended build.
</Accordion>
