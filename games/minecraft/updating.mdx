Update your server software (Paper, Spigot, Forge, etc) or modpacks using one of these methods.

## Manual Update

1. Download the latest version from:
   - [PaperMC](https://papermc.io/downloads)
   - [Spigot](https://spigotmc.org/wiki/buildtools)
   - [Forge](https://files.minecraftforge.net/)
2. Stop your server and [create a backup](/panel/backups)
3. Delete the old JAR file (usually `server.jar` - check your startup command)
4. Upload the new JAR file to the same directory. Keep the same filename, or update your startup command if it changed
5. Start your server and run `/version` to verify the update

<Warning>
  You can copy the download URL and paste it into the **Download From URL** button in the File Manager. See [this guide](/panel/importing-files#download-files-from-url) for details.
</Warning>
