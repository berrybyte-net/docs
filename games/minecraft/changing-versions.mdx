# How to Change Your Minecraft Server Version

Change your server version to access new features or maintain compatibility with players.

## Changing the Version

1. Stop your server and [create a backup](/panel/backups)
2. Go to the **Startup** tab and change the `Version` field
3. Go to the **Settings** tab and click **Reinstall**
4. Start your server and run `/version` to verify

<Warning>Downgrading is difficult and can corrupt worlds. Always backup first and check for incompatible blocks.</Warning>


### Java Version Requirements

If you get a Java error, change the `Java Version` in the **Settings** tab:

- **Java 8**: Minecraft 1.14 - 1.16.5
- **Java 16**: Minecraft 1.17 - 1.17.1
- **Java 17**: Minecraft 1.18+ (Recommended)
- **Java 18-21**: Latest versions

## Common Issues

**Server won't start**
- Java version incompatibility
- Fix: Update Java version in Settings tab

**World corruption after downgrading**
- Newer world data isn't compatible with older versions
- Fix: Restore from backup or use conversion tools

**Plugins stop working**

- Fix: Update plugins to compatible versions

**Players can't connect**
- Client-server version mismatch
- Fix: Have players update their Minecraft client
