Resource packs let you customize how Minecraft looks and sounds. Add custom textures, sounds, and UI elements to make your server unique.

## Size Limits

- **Minecraft 1.14 and below**: 50MB max
- **Minecraft 1.15+**: 100MB max

## Find or Create Your Resource Pack

Download packs from [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs) or create your own.

If creating your own, archive it with the `/assets` folder, `pack.mcmeta` file, and `pack.png` icon at the root.

## Host Your Resource Pack

You need to host your resource pack online so players can download it. Here are two options:

### Using MCPacks

1. Upload your pack to [MCPacks](https://mc-packs.net)
2. Copy the `resource-pack=` and `resource-pack-sha1=` values provided
3. MCPacks supports packs up to 95MB

### Dropbox Hosting

1. Upload your pack to Dropbox
2. Get a share link and change `dl=0` to `dl=1` for direct download
3. Optionally, [create a SHA-1 hash](http://www.sha1-online.com/) for verification

<Info>Test the link to make sure it downloads the pack directly.</Info>

## Configure Your Server

1. Open `server.properties` in the file manager
2. Add your resource pack URL and SHA-1 hash:

```yml
# Using MCPacks
resource-pack=https://download.mc-packs.net/pack/{ID}.zip

# Using Dropbox
resource-pack=https://www.dropbox.com/s/<ID>/MyCoolResourcePack.zip?dl=1

# SHA-1 hash (optional but recommended)
resource-pack-sha1=4c82e70abf8cd8bd3ce117fb69ecc3e0c846915b
```

3. Save and restart your server

Players will be prompted to download the resource pack when they join.
