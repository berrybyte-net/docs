RCON (Remote Console) lets you execute Minecraft server commands remotely without being in-game.

## Enable RCON

1. Stop your server
2. Open **Files -> `server.properties`**
3. Set `enable-rcon=true`
4. Set `rcon.password` to a secure password
5. Set `rcon.port` to a new port (create one in **Network -> Create Allocation**)
6. Save the file and restart your server
