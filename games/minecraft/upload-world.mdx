# How to Upload Custom Worlds to Your Minecraft Server

Upload your singleplayer worlds or custom maps to share with friends on your server.

<Warning>Make sure the world version matches your server version to prevent corruption.</Warning> 

## Finding Your World Files

### On Windows:

1. Press `Windows Key + R` and type `%AppData%`
2. Go to `.minecraft/saves`
3. Find your world folder and archive it with [WinRAR](https://winrar.com) or [7Zip](https://7zip.com)

### On Mac:

1. Open Spotlight and paste: `~/Library/Application Support/minecraft`
2. Go to the `saves` folder
3. Right-click your world folder and select **Compress**

## Uploading the World

1. Stop your server
2. [Upload the world archive](/panel/importing-files) to the File Manager
3. Click the three dots next to the file and click **Unarchive**
4. Open `server.properties` and change `level-name` to match your world folder name
5. Start your server

## Common Issues

**World doesn't load**
- Version mismatch or wrong folder structure
- Fix: Check world version matches server and ensure folder has `level.dat`

**Server crashes**
- Corrupted world data or missing files
- Fix: Re-upload the world archive

**Players spawn in wrong location**
- Spawn point not configured
- Fix: Use `/setworldspawn` command

**Features missing**

- Fix: Ensure complete world folder uploaded and versions match
