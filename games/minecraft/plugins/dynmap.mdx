# How to Install and Configure Dynmap

Dynmap creates live, web-based maps of your Minecraft worlds that players can view in any browser.

Note: More optimized alternatives include [BlueMap](https://github.com/BlueMap-Minecraft/BlueMap) and [squaremap](https://github.com/jpenilla/squaremap).

## Installation

1. Download Dynmap from [SpigotMC](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/dynmap%C2%AE.274/) (Bukkit) or [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/dynmapforge) (Forge/Fabric)
2. Place the JAR in `plugins` (Bukkit) or `mods` (Forge/Fabric) folder
3. Restart your server
4. Stop the server after it starts
5. Create a port in **Network** tab
6. Open `plugins/dynmap/configuration.txt`
7. Set the port and web path (e.g., `/dynmap`)
8. Start your server

<Warning>You need a public IP or port forwarding for others to access Dynmap.</Warning>

## Reverse Proxy (Custom Domain)

Use a reverse proxy to access Dynmap with a custom domain instead of an IP address.

### With berrybyte (Lime)

1. Create a DNS record pointing to `cotton.api.berrybyte.network` (set Cloudflare to DNS only if using it)
2. Go to **Proxies Manager** and click **Create Proxy**
3. Enter your domain in `Source` and the Dynmap port allocation in `Allocation`
4. Click **Create**

### Local/Other Provider (Advanced)

**Automatic setup:**
```bash
curl -s https://cdn.berrybyte.net/scripts/dynmap.sh | sudo bash
```

**Manual setup:**
1. Set up a server with Nginx: `sudo apt update && sudo apt -y install nginx`
2. Create DNS record pointing to the proxy server IP
3. Add Nginx config:

```nginx
server {
    server_name your-domain.com;
    listen 80;
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://YOUR-SERVER-IP:PORT;
    }
}
```

4. Restart Nginx: `sudo systemctl restart nginx`

## Usage

Access Dynmap at `http://your-server-ip:port/webpath` (e.g., `http://yourdomain.com:20029/dynmap`).

- Switch between maps using the dropdown
- View online players on the right
- Click player names to see their location
- Use the search bar to find locations or players

## Customization

Click **Configure Dynmap** in the web interface to adjust zoom, player visibility, and map appearance.

For advanced options, edit `plugins/dynmap/configuration.txt`.

## Common Issues

**Web interface won't load**
- Port or firewall issue
- Fix: Verify port configuration and firewall settings

**Map blank or not updating**
- World mapping or permissions issue
- Fix: Check `worlds.txt` and verify permissions

**Players can't access externally**
- Network/port forwarding issue
- Fix: Ensure port is forwarded and accessible

**High resource usage**
- Resource-intensive during initial generation
- Fix: Consider BlueMap or squaremap alternatives
