[Chunky](https://github.com/pop4959/Chunky) pre-generates chunks for your server, reducing CPU usage and lag spikes since players move through already-generated chunks.

## Installation

**Bukkit-based servers:**
- Download from [SpigotMC](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/chunky.81534/)
- Place the JAR in the `plugins` folder
- Restart your server

**Forge or Fabric servers:**
- Download from [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/chunky-pregenerator-forge) or [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/chunky)
- Place the JAR in the `/mods` folder
- Restart your server

## Usage

<Warning>Pre-generation increases world size. Check [onlinemo.de/world](https://onlinemo.de/world) to calculate size. Always [backup your server](/panel/backups) first.</Warning>

Basic commands:
- `/chunky radius <size>` - Set radius to pre-generate
- `/chunky center <x> <z>` - Set center point (default is usually fine)
- `/chunky start` - Start generation
- `/chunky pause` - Pause generation
- `/chunky resume` - Resume generation
- `/chunky stop` - Stop generation
- `/chunky status` - Check progress

See [Chunky's documentation](https://github.com/pop4959/Chunky/wiki) for more commands.

### Example

Pre-generate a 5000x5000 chunk area centered at `0,0`:
- `/chunky radius 5000`
- `/chunky center 0 0`
- `/chunky start`

<Warning>Large radius values can take hours. You can play while it runs, but expect some lag. Best to start it overnight.</Warning>
