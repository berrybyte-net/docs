# How to Join a Minecraft Server

Connect to your Minecraft server on Java or Bedrock Edition.

## Find Your Server IP

You need your server's IP address (numbers like `104.167.215.1`) or subdomain (like `test.berrybyte.net`) to connect.

1. Go to the [berrybyte game panel](https://game.berrybyte.net)
2. Find the IP:port or subdomain below your server name

## Joining on Java Edition
1. Launch Minecraft
2. Click **Multiplayer**
3. Click **Add Server**
4. Enter a name and your server's IP:port
5. Click the server from your list to join

**Tip:** You can also use **Direct Connection** to connect without adding the server first.

## Joining on Bedrock Edition
1. Launch Minecraft and click **Play**
2. Go to the **Servers** tab
3. Scroll down and click **Add Server**
4. Enter the **Server Name**, **Server Address**, and **Port**, then click **Save**
5. Select your server and click **Join Server**

Wait a few seconds for the connection to establish.

## Common Issues

**Connection timed out**
- Server may be offline or firewall blocking connection
- Check server status in control panel and verify IP is correct

**Can't resolve hostname**
- DNS issues or wrong server address
- Try using the numeric IP instead of subdomain

**Outdated client/server**
- Version mismatch between client and server
- Make sure your Minecraft version matches the server

**Bedrock players can't join Java server**
- Different editions aren't compatible by default
- Install the [Geyser plugin](/games/minecraft/plugins/geyser) for cross-platform play
