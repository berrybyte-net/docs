This error occurs when the server can't access the session file, preventing startup.

<Warning>Error: `net.Minecraft.server.WorldConlictException: Failed to check session lock, aborting.`</Warning>

## Fix

1. Stop your server
2. Open the world folder in the file manager
3. Delete the `session.lock` file
4. Start your server

The session file will regenerate automatically.
