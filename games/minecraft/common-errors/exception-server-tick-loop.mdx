This error usually means a JSON configuration file is corrupted.

<Warning>Error: `java.lang.NullPointerException: Exception in server tick loop`</Warning>

## Fix

1. Stop your server
2. Go to the file manager
3. Delete these files:
   - `whitelist.json`
   - `banned-player.json`
   - `banned-ips.json`
4. Start your server

The files will regenerate automatically.

**Alternative:** [Restore a backup](/panel/backups#mounting) or fix the JSON files with a [validator](https://jsonlint.com/) (ensure they start and end with `[]`).
