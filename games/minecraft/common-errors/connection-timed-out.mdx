# How to Fix Minecraft 'Connection Timed Out' Error

Fix connection timeout errors when joining Minecraft servers.

## Common Causes

1. Server has insufficient resources
2. Host network outage - check [status page](https://status.berrybyte.net/)
3. Proxy misconfigured (BungeeCord/Velocity/Waterfall)
4. ISP/network issues (most common) - restart router or contact ISP

## Solutions

1. **Check proxy configuration** (if using one)
2. **Restart your server**
3. **Test connection** - use [mcsrvstat.us](https://mcsrvstat.us) to check server status
4. **Use a VPN** - try [Cloudflare WARP](https://1.1.1.1/) for better routing
5. **Increase keepalive timeout** (Paper servers):
   - Add `-Dpaper.playerconnection.keepalive=90` to startup flags
6. **Run MTR diagnostics** - [take an MTR](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-mtr/) and [share results](https://berrybyte.net/tickets) with support
