You may get kicked with `Flying is not enabled on this server` even when not flying. This happens because flying is disabled by default, preventing elytra use.

## Enable Flying

1. Open `server.properties` in the file manager
2. Find `allow-flight` and set it to `true`
3. Save the file
4. Restart your server

Flying (including elytra) will now be allowed.
