Want to protect your server from unwanted joins? You can set a password on your Palworld server to put it behind lock and key, ensuring only you and the people you share the password with can join the server!

## Setting a password

1. Login to the [game panel](https://game.berrybyte.net)
2. Navigate to the **Startup** tab
3. Enter a password in the **Server Password** field

</Frame>
4. Restart the server

This will set the password you entered and will ask all players who join for the password.
