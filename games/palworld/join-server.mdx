Palworld servers allow you and your friends to experience this new multiplayer open-world monster-hunting survival and crafting game set in the islands of Palpalagos together. You can collect "Pals", and build amazing bases and creations!

To experience all of that, you'll need to know how to connect and join your Palworld server.

## Finding the IP address

Before you can join and connect to your [Palworld server](https://berrybyte.net/palworld), you'll need to find the [IP address](https://whatismyipaddress.com/ip-address) (a combination of numbers, e.g `104.167.215.1`).

1. Login to the [game control panel](https://game.berrybyte.net)
2. Locate the subdomain or IP:port below the name of the server
