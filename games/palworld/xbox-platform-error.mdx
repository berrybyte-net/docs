Sometimes, when [Pocketpair](https://www.pocketpair.jp/palworld), the devs behind the hit-game [Palworld](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1623730/Palworld/), release a new update, you may be faced with the error: `Sorry, you're currently prevented from playing with people on platforms other than the Xbox network. Closing this dialog cancels the invitation.`

This error, "Sorry, you're currently prevented from playing online multiplayer games", usually happens because of an outdated game client. To fix this error, **restart your Xbox and your [Palworld dedicated server](https://berrybyte.net/palworld-server-hosting)**.
