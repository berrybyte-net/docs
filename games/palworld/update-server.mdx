Every time Pocketpair, the creators behind the game Palworld, releases patches, bug fixes, and new features for the game, you'll need to update the servers as well. If the server or game isn't updated, you may encounter the `the match you are trying to join is running an incompatible version of the game.` error.

Luckily, we've simplified the whole process for you to a single click of a button at [BerryByte](https://berrybyte.net/palworld)!
