## Installing Mods on a Palworld Server

Adding mods to your Palworld server can make your gameplay even better. Here's a quick guide to get you started.

## Before You Start

- Make sure you have admin access to your server.
- Check if your mods are `.pak` files and work with your current Palworld version.
- Make sure everyone playing on your server installs the exact same mods, so everything runs smoothly.


## Steps to Add Mods

- Download the `.pak` mod file from a trusted site.
- Head to the **Files** tab on the [game panel](https://game.berrybyte.net)
- Find the `Pal/Content/Paks/` folder.
- Upload your `.pak` mod file into this folder.
- On your PC, put the same `.pak` file into your Palworld game's `Pal/Content/Paks/` folder.
- Restart your server to activate your mods.

That's it! Enjoy customizing your Palworld server.
