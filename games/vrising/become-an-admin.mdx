## Using adminlist.txt file

You can use the adminlist.txt file on your server to add an administrator to your V Rising dedicated server.

1. Open the **Files** tab
2. Navigate to `/settings/adminlist.txt`
3. Add the [SteamID64](https://www.steamidfinder.com/) ID of the player you want to make admin to the file
4. **Save** the file
5. **Restart** the server
