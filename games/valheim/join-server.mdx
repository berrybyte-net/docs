## Finding the IP address

Before you can join and connect to your [Valheim server](https://berrybyte.net/valheim-server-hosting), you'll need to find the [IP address](https://whatismyipaddress.com/ip-address) (a combination of numbers, e.g `104.167.215.1`).

1. Login to the [game control panel](https://game.berrybyte.net)
