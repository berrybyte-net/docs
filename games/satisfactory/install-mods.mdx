# How to Install Mods

While Satisfactory does not officially support mods, you can use the Satisfactory Mod Manager to install them on your [Satisfactory server](https://berrybyte.net/satisfactory-server-hosting). You can download the Satisfactory Mod Manager from [this link](https://ficsit.app/).

<Warning>
Satisfactory servers are in early access in the vanilla game. Adding mods can and most likely will increase the likelihood that you run into crashes and issues. Make sure to backup your save if you don't want to break your game and lose progress.

Not all mods work on servers. You must read each mod's documentation to ensure it will work on a server.
</Warning>

## Steps

### 1. Install the Satisfactory Mod Manager

Download and install the Satisfactory Mod Manager from the official website.

### 2. Connect to Your Server

1. Open the Satisfactory Mod Manager
2. Click **Manage Servers**
3. Enter your server connection details:
   - **SFTP username and password** (found in your server's Settings tab)
   - **Server IP address**
   - **Path**: Use the default path provided
4. Click **Add**

### 3. Verify Server Connection

If done correctly, you should see your server listed in the server management interface.

### 4. Select Server Target

1. Click the dropdown menu
2. Select **Early Access (Remote 1)**
3. This will select the server as the target for mod installation

### 5. Install Mods

1. Browse the available mods in the mod manager
2. Select a mod that supports Linux dedicated servers (like Refined Power)
3. Click install

<Note>
It is recommended to install mods one at a time to ensure they work properly. Some mods may show a compatibility message - you cannot install these until the developer adds server support.
</Note>

### 6. Install Mods Locally

1. Each mod will take some time to install depending on the size
2. Once server installation is finished, switch the source back to **Early Access (Steam)**
3. Install the same mods on your PC

<Warning>
All players connecting to the server must also use the Satisfactory Mod Manager to install their mods locally. They only need to install them on their own computers, not on the server.
</Warning>

### 7. Verify Installation

You can verify that your mods have been installed by:

1. Opening your server's file manager
2. Navigating to `/steamcmd/satisfactory/FactoryGame/Mods/`
3. Checking that the mod files are present

## Troubleshooting

- If mods aren't working, ensure all players have the same mods installed locally
- Check mod compatibility with dedicated servers before installation
- Consider installing mods one at a time to identify any problematic mods
- Always backup your save files before installing new mods
