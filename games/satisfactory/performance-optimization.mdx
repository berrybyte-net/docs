# Satisfactory Server Performance Optimization

Optimize your [Satisfactory server](https://berrybyte.net/satisfactory-server-hosting) to handle large factories without lag. This guide covers server settings, factory design, and hardware optimization.

## Server Settings

Edit `GameUserSettings.ini`:

```ini
[/Script/FactoryGame.FGServerSubsystem]
mAutoPause=True
mAutoSaveInterval=600
mNetworkQuality=3
mServerRestartTimeSlot=04:00
```

**Startup Parameters:**
```bash
-USEALLAVAILABLECORES -NoVerifyGC -UseMultithreadForDS
```

## Factory Optimization

**Belt Design:**
- Use direct routing, avoid complex intersections
- Minimize belt length and unnecessary splitters
- Stack belts vertically to save space

**Machine Layout:**
- Group similar machines together
- Use local storage for intermediate products
- Implement central power distribution

**Building Tips:**
- Use minimal foundations and decorative elements
- Avoid excessive lighting in automated areas
- Remove unused structures regularly

## Hardware Requirements

| Factory Size | CPU | RAM | Storage |
|--------------|-----|-----|---------|
| Small (1-2 players) | 4 cores | 8GB | 20GB SSD |
| Medium (3-4 players) | 6 cores | 16GB | 40GB NVMe |
| Large factories | 8+ cores | 32GB | 60GB+ NVMe |

**Maintenance:**
- Restart server daily
- Clean up old save files
- Monitor memory usage
- Use SSD storage

## Performance Monitoring

**Key Metrics:**
- Server FPS (target: 30+)
- Memory usage (under 80%)
- CPU utilization
- Network latency (under 100ms)

**Monitoring Tools:**
- Press `Ctrl + Shift + L` for performance overlay
- Use `stat fps` console command
- Monitor task manager for resource usage

## Best Practices

**Factory Design:**
- Use modular production areas
- Implement power zones with switches
- Plan belt routing before building
- Minimize transport distances

**Maintenance:**
- Restart server daily
- Clean up save files weekly
- Monitor performance metrics
- Update software regularly
