# Satisfactory Server Common Issues

Common problems and solutions for [Satisfactory servers](https://berrybyte.net/satisfactory-server-hosting), from connection issues to factory performance problems.

## Connection Issues

**Can't Connect to Server:**
1. Verify server is running in control panel
2. Check ports 7777, 15000, 15777 (UDP) are open
3. Test server connectivity with ping
4. Restart server to re-register with Steam

**Server Not in Browser:**
- Wait 5-10 minutes for new servers to appear
- Restart server to re-register
- Check Steam server status at steamstat.us

**Version Mismatch:**
- Update Satisfactory through Steam
- Verify game files integrity
- Coordinate updates with all players

## Performance Issues

**Factory Lag/Low FPS:**
- Reduce active machines with power switches
- Simplify belt networks and routing
- Remove decorative elements
- Implement factory zones

**Memory Issues:**
- Increase server RAM (16GB+ recommended)
- Enable auto-pause when empty
- Restart server daily
- Clean up old save files

**Production Problems:**
- Check machine efficiency for bottlenecks
- Optimize belt routing with direct paths
- Balance power consumption
- Minimize transport distances

## Multiplayer Issues

**Player Desync:**
- Coordinate building times to avoid conflicts
- Regular save/reload to resync server state
- Ensure stable connections for all players
- Restart server if desync persists

**Building Conflicts:**
- Assign factory zones per player
- Use voice chat during construction
- Plan major builds together
- Save before major changes

**Resource Management:**
- Establish designated mining areas
- Create central resource hubs
- Divide manufacturing roles
- Use Discord for coordination

## Save File Issues

**Corrupted Saves:**
- Stop server immediately when detected
- Restore from most recent backup
- Check save file integrity and sizes
- Test world loading before going live

**World Loading Problems:**
- Verify save compatibility with server version
- Check world size and complexity
- Monitor loading times for large worlds
- Consider world reset if severely corrupted

## Mod Issues

**Compatibility Problems:**
- Ensure all players have identical mod lists
- Update to latest compatible versions
- Test mod combinations for conflicts
- Remove problematic mods

**Performance Impact:**
- Remove unnecessary mods
- Monitor mod resource usage
- Update mods regularly
- Choose performance-friendly alternatives

## Update Issues

**Server Won't Update:**
```bash
# Manual update via SteamCMD
steamcmd +force_install_dir ./satisfactory_server/ +login anonymous +app_update 1690800 +quit
```
- Check server version after update
- Verify file integrity
- Test server startup
- Always backup before updates

**Configuration Reset:**
- Backup config files before updates
- Document custom settings
- Compare configs after updates
- Restore custom settings if overwritten

## Factory Problems

**Production Failures:**
- Check power supply and generation
- Verify resource flow and belt paths
- Check machine efficiency and overclocking
- Ensure correct recipe inputs available

**Belt Issues:**
- Simplify routing and reduce complexity
- Check belt capacity and throughput
- Monitor item flow for bottlenecks
- Use smart splitters for distribution

**Power Grid Problems:**
- Calculate power demand vs generation
- Check power line connections
- Monitor consumption in high-usage areas
- Implement power switches for control
