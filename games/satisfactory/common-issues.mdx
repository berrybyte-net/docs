4. **Communication tools** - Discord or in-game chat

## Save File and World Issues

### Corrupted Save Files

**Symptoms:**
- Server won't load world
- Missing factory sections
- Player progress lost

**Solutions:**

#### Save File Recovery
1. **Stop server immediately** when corruption detected
2. **Restore from backup** - Use most recent clean save
3. **Check save file integrity** - Verify file sizes
4. **Test world loading** before going live

#### Backup Strategy
```bash
# Automated backup script example
# Daily backups with rotation
# Test restore procedures
# Multiple backup locations
```

### World Generation Problems

**Issues with world loading or terrain:**

#### World Troubleshooting
1. **Verify save file** compatibility with server version
2. **Check world size** and complexity
3. **Monitor loading times** - Large worlds take longer
4. **Consider world reset** if severely corrupted
