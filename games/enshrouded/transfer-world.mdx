3. Go to Files and select the savegame folder. 
4. Create a new directory called "old" and drag all the files to it. 
5. This will create a backup of the world, just to be safe. Configure full server backups [here](/lime/backups.mdx).

## Locating the Enshrouded world files
1. To explore the Enshrouded world files, locate the installation directory of steam. This often located under **C:\Steam\**
2. Navigate to the following directory: **\Steam\userdata\"steamid"\1203620\remote**
3. Locate the file with a string of 8 characters. This is often called **3ad85aea**
NOTE: If the game file has a different name please rename it to **3ad85aea** before uploading.
