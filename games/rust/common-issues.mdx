# Rust Server Common Issues

Common problems and solutions for Rust servers, from connection issues to performance problems.

## Connection Issues

**Can't Connect to Server:**
- Verify server is running in control panel
- Check port 28015 (UDP) is open
- Test connectivity with ping command
- Restart server to re-register with Steam

**Server Not in Browser:**
- Wait 10-15 minutes for new servers to appear
- Restart server to re-register
- Check Steam server status at steamstat.us

**High Ping/Lag:**
- Choose server location closest to players
- Use network optimization parameters:
```bash
+server.tickrate 30
+fps.limit 60
```

## Performance Issues

**Low Server FPS:**
- Increase RAM allocation (16GB+ recommended)
- Reduce world size: `+server.worldsize 3000`
- Remove unnecessary plugins
- Use SSD storage

**Memory Issues:**
- Force garbage collection: `gc.collect`
- Monitor usage: `pool.print_memory`
- Use memory optimization: `+gc.buffer 256`

**Server Crashes:**
- Check plugin compatibility with Rust version
- Review error logs in `oxide/logs/`
- Disable plugins one by one to find issues
- Restore from backup if world files corrupted

## Admin Issues

**Admin Commands Not Working:**
- Check admin status with `status` command
- Re-add admin: `ownerid STEAMID64 "Name" "Admin"`
- For uMod: `oxide.grant user STEAMID64 admin`

**Plugin Commands Not Responding:**
- Verify plugin loaded: `oxide.plugins`
- Reload plugin: `oxide.reload PluginName`
- Grant permissions: `oxide.grant user STEAMID64 pluginname.use`

## World Issues

**World Generation Problems:**
- Change world seed: `+server.seed 12345`
- Adjust world size: `+server.worldsize 4000`
- Restart server to apply changes

**Save File Corruption:**
- Stop server immediately
- Restore from latest backup
- Test world integrity before going live
- Check for `.sav` backup files in server folder

## Update Issues

**Server Won't Update:**
```bash
# Manual update via SteamCMD
steamcmd +force_install_dir ./rust_server/ +login anonymous +app_update 258550 +quit
```
- Check file permissions and disk space
- Ensure SteamCMD has write access

**Plugin Compatibility:**
- Check plugin compatibility with new Rust version
- Update plugins to latest versions
- Backup configs before updating
- Test critical plugins before opening server

## Player Issues

**Player Data Corruption:**
- Check player data backups in control panel
- Restore individual player files if available
- Use admin commands to restore items/blueprints
- Enable automatic backups for prevention

**Authentication Issues:**
- Restart Steam client completely
- Verify game files integrity
- Enable VAC protection: `+server.secure 1`

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Why does my server crash during peak hours?">
High player counts increase resource usage. Monitor RAM/CPU and consider upgrading hardware or reducing max players.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How often should I restart my server?">
Daily restarts during low-population hours help clear memory and apply updates.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What causes 'Connection Failed' errors?">
Usually network issues, server overload, or Steam authentication problems. Check server status and connectivity first.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I recover from corrupted world save?">
Stop server immediately and restore from most recent backup. Generate new world if no backup exists.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Admin commands not working?">
Check admin status with `status` command, re-add admin permissions, or grant uMod admin access.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Plugins causing crashes or not working?">
Check plugin compatibility, review error logs, disable plugins one by one to identify issues.
