# Rust Server Common Issues & Troubleshooting Guide

Running a Rust server comes with various challenges. This comprehensive troubleshooting guide covers the most common issues server owners face, from connection problems to performance optimization, with practical solutions for each problem.

Whether you're hosting on [BerryByte](https://berrybyte.net/rust-server-hosting) or self-hosting, these solutions will help you maintain a stable, high-performance Rust server.

## Connection Issues

### Players Can't Connect to Server

**Symptoms:**
- "Connection Failed" errors
- Server not appearing in browser
- Timeout errors during connection

**Solutions:**

#### Check Server Status
1. **Verify server is running** in control panel
2. **Check server console** for error messages
3. **Confirm server startup** completed successfully

#### Port Configuration
1. **Verify port 28015** is open (UDP)
2. **Check firewall settings** on server
3. **Confirm port forwarding** (self-hosted servers)
4. **Test port accessibility** with online tools

#### Network Troubleshooting
```bash
# Test server connectivity
ping your-server-ip
telnet your-server-ip 28015
```

### Server Not Showing in Browser

**Common causes and fixes:**

#### Steam Server Registration
- **Wait 10-15 minutes** for new servers to appear
- **Restart server** to re-register with Steam
- **Check Steam server status** at [steamstat.us](https://steamstat.us)

#### Server Configuration
```bash
# Ensure these settings in server config
+server.hostname "Your Server Name"
+server.description "Server Description"
+server.url "http://yourwebsite.com"
+server.headerimage "http://yoursite.com/image.jpg"
```

### High Ping and Lag Issues

**Performance optimization steps:**

#### Server Location
- **Choose server closest** to player base
- **Consider multiple locations** for global players
- **Monitor ping times** regularly

#### Network Optimization
```bash
# Server startup parameters for better networking
+server.tickrate 30
+server.netcache_size 100
+fps.limit 60
```

## Performance Problems

### Low Server FPS

**Symptoms:**
- Server FPS below 20-30
- Stuttering gameplay
- Delayed player actions

**Solutions:**

#### Resource Allocation
1. **Increase RAM allocation** (minimum 8GB, recommended 16GB+)
2. **Ensure adequate CPU cores** (4+ cores recommended)
3. **Use SSD storage** for better I/O performance

#### World Size Optimization
```bash
# Reduce world size for better performance
+server.worldsize 3000  # Instead of 4000
+server.maxplayers 50   # Reduce if needed
```

#### Plugin Management
1. **Audit installed plugins** - remove unnecessary ones
2. **Update plugins regularly** - newer versions often perform better
3. **Monitor plugin resource usage** - identify performance hogs

### Memory Issues

**High RAM usage solutions:**

#### Garbage Collection
```bash
# Force garbage collection
gc.collect

# Monitor memory usage
pool.print_memory
```

#### Memory Optimization Settings
```bash
# Startup parameters for memory management
+gc.buffer 256
+pool.mode 2
```

### Server Crashes

**Common crash causes and fixes:**

#### Plugin-Related Crashes
1. **Check plugin compatibility** with current Rust version
2. **Review error logs** in `oxide/logs/`
3. **Disable plugins one by one** to identify culprit
4. **Update or remove problematic plugins**

#### Memory-Related Crashes
1. **Increase server RAM** allocation
2. **Monitor memory usage** trends
3. **Implement automatic restarts** during low-population hours

#### Corrupted World Files
1. **Restore from backup** if available
2. **Generate new world** with different seed
3. **Check storage device** for hardware issues

## Admin and Permission Issues

### Admin Commands Not Working

**Troubleshooting steps:**

#### Verify Admin Status
```bash
# Check if you're properly set as admin
status
# Look for your name in admin list
```

#### Permission Configuration
```bash
# Re-add admin permissions
ownerid STEAMID64 "YourName" "Admin"
server.writecfg
```

#### uMod Permission Issues
```bash
# Grant admin permissions in uMod
oxide.grant user STEAMID64 admin
oxide.usergroup add STEAMID64 admin
```

### Plugin Commands Not Responding

**Common solutions:**

#### Plugin Status Check
```bash
# Verify plugin is loaded
oxide.plugins

# Reload problematic plugin
oxide.reload PluginName
```

#### Permission Verification
```bash
# Check user permissions
oxide.show user STEAMID64

# Grant specific plugin permissions
oxide.grant user STEAMID64 pluginname.use
```

## World and Map Issues

### World Generation Problems

**Symptoms:**
- Blank or corrupted terrain
- Missing monuments
- Unusual landscape features

**Solutions:**

#### Regenerate World
```bash
# Change world seed to generate new map
+server.seed 12345
# Restart server to apply changes
```

#### Verify World Size
```bash
# Ensure world size is appropriate
+server.worldsize 4000  # Standard size
# Smaller sizes: 3000, 2000, 1000
```

### Save File Corruption

**Recovery steps:**

#### Restore from Backup
1. **Stop server immediately**
2. **Restore latest backup** from control panel
3. **Test world integrity** before going live

#### Manual Save Recovery
1. **Navigate to** `server/SERVERNAME/` folder
2. **Look for** `.sav` backup files
3. **Replace corrupted** save with backup
4. **Restart server** and test

## Update and Maintenance Issues

### Server Won't Update

**Update troubleshooting:**

#### Manual Update Process
```bash
# Stop server first
# Run SteamCMD update
steamcmd +force_install_dir ./rust_server/ +login anonymous +app_update 258550 +quit
```

#### File Permission Issues
1. **Check file permissions** on server directory
2. **Ensure SteamCMD** has write access
3. **Run as administrator** if needed (Windows)

#### Disk Space Problems
1. **Check available storage** space
2. **Clean up old logs** and temporary files
3. **Remove unused plugins** and files

### Plugin Compatibility After Updates

**Post-update checklist:**

#### Plugin Verification
1. **Check plugin compatibility** with new Rust version
2. **Update plugins** to latest versions
3. **Test critical plugins** before opening server

#### Configuration Review
1. **Backup current configs** before updating
2. **Compare config changes** after update
3. **Restore custom settings** if overwritten

## Player-Related Issues

### Player Data Corruption

**Symptoms:**
- Players spawn as fresh spawns
- Lost player progress
- Inventory/blueprint issues

**Solutions:**

#### Player Data Recovery
1. **Check player data backups** in control panel
2. **Restore individual player files** if available
3. **Use admin commands** to restore items/blueprints

#### Prevention Measures
1. **Enable automatic backups** for player data
2. **Regular manual backups** before major changes
3. **Monitor player data** file sizes for corruption

### Authentication Issues

**Steam authentication problems:**

#### VAC Authentication Errors
1. **Restart Steam client** completely
2. **Verify game files** integrity
3. **Check VAC status** and wait if issues exist

#### Server-Side Authentication
```bash
# Check server authentication settings
+server.secure 1  # Enable VAC protection
```

## Monitoring and Prevention

### Server Health Monitoring

**Key metrics to track:**

#### Performance Metrics
- **Server FPS** (target: 25-30+)
- **RAM usage** (should not exceed 80%)
- **CPU usage** (sustained high usage indicates issues)
- **Network latency** (ping times)

#### Log Monitoring
1. **Review server logs** daily
2. **Check plugin error logs** regularly
3. **Monitor crash reports** and patterns

### Preventive Maintenance

**Regular maintenance tasks:**

#### Weekly Tasks
- **Review server performance** metrics
- **Check for plugin updates**
- **Clean up log files**
- **Test backup restoration**

#### Monthly Tasks
- **Full server backup** before major changes
- **Review and update plugins**
- **Analyze player feedback** and issues
- **Plan server optimizations**

High player counts increase resource usage. Monitor RAM/CPU usage and consider upgrading hardware or reducing max players during peak times.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How often should I restart my Rust server?">
Most servers benefit from daily restarts during low-population hours to clear memory and apply updates.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What causes 'Connection Failed' errors?">
Usually network issues, server overload, or Steam authentication problems. Check server status and network connectivity first.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I recover from a corrupted world save?">
Stop the server immediately and restore from the most recent backup. If no backup exists, you may need to generate a new world.
