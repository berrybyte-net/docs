# How to Setup a Rust Dedicated Server

Setting up your own Rust dedicated server gives you complete control over your survival multiplayer experience. Whether you're hosting for friends or building a community server, this guide covers everything from initial setup to advanced configuration for optimal Rust server performance.

[Rust](https://store.steampowered.com/app/252490/Rust/) is a hardcore multiplayer survival game where players must gather resources, build bases, and survive against other players and the environment. **[BerryByte](https://berrybyte.net/rust-server-hosting)** provides powerful Rust server hosting with instant setup, NVMe SSD storage, and 24/7 uptime.

## Rust Server Requirements

Before setting up your Rust dedicated server, ensure your system meets these minimum requirements:

| Component | Minimum | Recommended |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| **CPU** | 4 cores | 6+ cores |
| **RAM** | 8GB | 16GB+ |
| **Storage** | 20GB SSD | 50GB+ NVMe SSD |
| **Network** | 100Mbps | 1Gbps |

## Quick Setup with BerryByte

1. **Select your plan** at [berrybyte.net/rust-server-hosting](https://berrybyte.net/rust-server-hosting)
2. **Choose server location** closest to your players
3. **Complete checkout** and check your email
4. **Login to game panel** at [game.berrybyte.net](https://game.berrybyte.net)
5. **Start your server** - it's ready to play immediately!

Your Rust server will be online within minutes with automatic updates and DDoS protection included.

## Manual Server Setup (Advanced)

### Step 1: Install SteamCMD

**Windows:**
1. Download SteamCMD from [Valve's website](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/SteamCMD)
2. Extract to `C:\steamcmd\`
3. Run `steamcmd.exe`

**Linux:**
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install steamcmd
```

### Step 2: Download Rust Server Files

**Windows:**
```cmd
steamcmd.exe +force_install_dir c:\rust_server\ +login anonymous +app_update 258550 +quit
```

**Linux:**
```bash
steamcmd +force_install_dir ./rust_server/ +login anonymous +app_update 258550 +quit
```

### Step 3: Configure Server Settings

1. **Navigate to server directory**
2. **Create startup script** with these parameters:
   - `-batchmode` - Run without graphics
   - `+server.port 28015` - Set server port
   - `+server.identity "myserver"` - Server identity folder
   - `+server.seed 12345` - World seed
   - `+server.worldsize 4000` - Map size
   - `+server.maxplayers 100` - Player limit

**Example Windows batch file:**
```batch
RustDedicated.exe -batchmode +server.port 28015 +server.identity "myserver" +server.seed 12345 +server.worldsize 4000 +server.maxplayers 100 +server.hostname "My Rust Server" +server.description "Welcome to my server"
```

### Step 4: Port Forwarding

Open these ports on your router/firewall:
- **28015** (UDP) - Game port
- **28016** (TCP) - RCON port (optional)

## Server Configuration Options

### Basic Settings

- **server.hostname** - Server name in browser
- **server.description** - Server description
- **server.maxplayers** - Maximum players (default: 100)
- **server.worldsize** - Map size (1000-4000)
- **server.seed** - World generation seed

### Advanced Settings

- **server.tickrate** - Server update rate (default: 30)
- **server.saveinterval** - Auto-save frequency (seconds)
- **decay.scale** - Building decay multiplier
- **gather.rate** - Resource gathering multiplier

## Common Server Issues

### Server Won't Start
- **Check port availability** - Ensure port 28015 isn't in use
- **Verify file integrity** - Re-download server files if corrupted
- **Check system resources** - Ensure adequate RAM and CPU

### Players Can't Connect
- **Verify port forwarding** - Check router configuration
- **Check firewall settings** - Allow Rust through Windows Firewall
- **Confirm server status** - Ensure server is running and responsive

### Performance Issues
- **Reduce world size** - Smaller maps use less resources
- **Lower max players** - Fewer players = better performance
- **Increase RAM allocation** - Add more system memory

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="How much RAM does a Rust server need?">
A Rust server requires minimum 8GB RAM, but 16GB+ is recommended for optimal performance with 50+ players.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I change the map after server creation?">
Yes, you can change the world seed and size, but this will generate a completely new map and reset all player progress.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How often should I wipe my Rust server?">
Most servers wipe monthly on the first Thursday when Rust updates. Some servers do weekly or bi-weekly wipes depending on community preference.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What's the difference between map wipe and BP wipe?">
Map wipe resets the world and buildings. BP (blueprint) wipe also resets player research progress and learned blueprints.
