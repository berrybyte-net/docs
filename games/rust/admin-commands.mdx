# Complete Rust Admin Commands Guide

Master your Rust server administration with this comprehensive command reference. Whether you're managing players, controlling server settings, or troubleshooting issues, these admin commands give you complete control over your multiplayer survival server.

This guide covers both vanilla Rust commands and enhanced [uMod plugin commands](/games/rust/install-oxide) for [Rust servers](https://berrybyte.net/rust-server-hosting).

## Getting Admin Access

### Method 1: Server Console (Recommended)

1. **Access server console** (varies by host)
2. **Add yourself as admin:**
   ```
   ownerid STEAMID64 "YourName" "reason"
   ```
3. **Save configuration:**
   ```
   server.writecfg
   ```

### Method 2: Configuration File

1. **Edit `server/cfg/users.cfg`**
2. **Add line:**
   ```
   ownerid STEAMID64 "YourName" "Admin"
   ```
3. **Restart server** to apply changes

### Method 3: In-Game (If Already Admin)

```
/addowner STEAMID64
/addmoderator STEAMID64
```

## Command Usage Tips

### Finding Player Information
```bash
players                   # Get player list with SteamIDs
status                    # Detailed player information
```

### Using SteamID64
- **More reliable** than player names
- **Doesn't change** if player changes name
- **Required for** permanent bans and permissions

### Command Syntax Rules
- **Use quotes** around names with spaces: `"Player Name"`
- **Case sensitive** for some commands
- **Tab completion** works in most consoles
- **Check spelling** - typos cause command failures

## Common Admin Scenarios

### Dealing with Cheaters
1. **Spectate suspicious player:**
   ```bash
   /vanish
   teleport "YourName" "SuspiciousPlayer"
   ```

2. **Gather evidence** and take screenshots

3. **Ban permanently:**
   ```bash
   ban "PlayerName" "Cheating - Evidence: Screenshot"
   ```

### Server Events
1. **Spawn helicopter:**
   ```bash
   entity.spawn "helicopter"
   ```

2. **Create supply drop:**
   ```bash
   entity.spawn "supply_drop"
   ```

3. **Teleport all to event:**
   ```bash
   /tpall
   ```

### Emergency Situations
1. **Stop server attacks:**
   ```bash
   /vanish
   /god
   ```

2. **Mass kick griefers:**
   ```bash
   kick "Griefer1" "Mass griefing"
   kick "Griefer2" "Mass griefing"
   ```

3. **Save and restart if needed:**
   ```bash
   save
   restart
   ```
