We want every customer to have a smooth experience on berrybyte. If something doesn’t go as expected, our refund process is designed to be simple and transparent.

---

## 2-Day Refund Policy

We offer a **2-day (48 hour) refund window for any reason**.

If you request a refund within 48 hours of the charge, we will issue it.

This applies to:
- New subscriptions  
- Renewals  
- Plan upgrades

Your server will remain active until the refund is processed, unless you request immediate cancellation.

---

## Refunds After 2 Days

Refund requests made **after** the initial 2-day window may still be approved if there is a **clear billing error**, such as:

- A duplicate charge  
- A charge higher than expected  
- A subscription created by accident  
- A renewal you attempted to cancel but system–side error prevented  

If the charge was correct and the service was used, refunds past the 2-day window are typically not eligible.

---

## Refund Method

Refunds are issued to the **original payment method** by default.  
If you prefer, we can instead provide **account credit**, which:

- Never expires  
- Can be used on any future berrybyte server  
- Applies automatically at checkout  

Just let us know your preference in the ticket.
