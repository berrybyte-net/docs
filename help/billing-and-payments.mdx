berrybyte uses a simple monthly subscription model for all servers. Your billing cycle begins on the day you create your server, and renews on the same date each month unless you cancel the subscription.

This guide explains how billing works, how payments are processed, and where to manage your billing information.

---

## How Billing Works

- Each server has its **own billing subscription**.  
- Billing renews **once per month** on your server’s renewal date.  
- Upgrades are **prorated**, meaning you only pay the difference for the remainder of the current billing cycle.  
- Downgrades apply at the **next renewal** to prevent data loss or instability.  
- You may cancel at any time, and your server will stay active until the end of the paid period.

Your renewal date is always shown on your **Billing** page and inside each server’s **Overview** section.

## Payment Processing

berrybyte currently accepts all major credit and debit cards. Payments are securely processed through our PCI-compliant payment partner.

A few things to note:

- Your card is charged automatically at renewal.  
- If a payment fails, you’ll receive email notifications with instructions to fix it.  
- You can retry a failed payment at any time by updating your card or re-submitting payment from the Billing page.

## Managing Your Billing Information

You can manage billing settings from the **Account → Billing** section.  
From there, you can:

- Add or remove payment methods  
- View upcoming renewal dates  
- See past invoices  
- Download receipts  
- Update your billing email  
- Fix failed payments  
- Apply promo codes (if available)

Any changes take effect immediately.

## Prorated Charges (Upgrades)

When you upgrade a server:

- You are only charged **the difference** between your old plan and the new plan  
- The charge covers **the remaining days** in your current billing cycle  
- Your renewal date **does not change**

This prevents double-charging and makes upgrades flexible and safe.

## Failed Payments & Grace Period

If a payment fails, we will:

1. Notify you by email  
2. Attempt to process the payment again  
3. Provide a short grace period of **3 days** before suspension  

During the grace period, your services remain active so you can resolve the issue without downtime.

After **7 days**, the service and it's associated data will be terminated.
