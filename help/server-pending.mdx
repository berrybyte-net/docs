# Server Stuck on Pending

Your server is stuck on "Pending"? Try these steps:

1. **Wait 10 minutes** - Most servers activate automatically
2. **Check your email** - Look for the "Account Created" email with your login link
3. **Refresh the page** - The status might have updated
4. **Contact support** - If it's still pending after 10 minutes, [we'll activate it for you](https://berrybyte.net/contact)

## Still Having Issues?

**Payment charged but server not created?**
- Your server will be created once the issue is fixed
- No extra charges will occur

**Can't access your panel?**
- Wait for the "Account Created" email first
- Check your spam folder
- Use the login link from the email
