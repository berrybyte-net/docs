- [ ] Game client updated?

## Connection Issues

### Can't Connect to Server

1. **Check server status** - Make sure it's online in your panel
2. **Verify IP and port** - Copy the exact IP from your panel
3. **Check game version** - Make sure your game client matches the server version
4. **Try restarting** - Stop and start the server
5. **Check firewall** - Temporarily disable to test if it's blocking

### Server Shows Offline

1. **Force restart** - Stop, wait 30 seconds, then start again
2. **Check resources** - Monitor RAM/CPU usage, upgrade if needed
3. **Check console** - Look for error messages or crash reports

## Performance Issues

### Server Lag

1. **Check resources** - Monitor RAM (should stay below 80%) and CPU usage
2. **Disable unnecessary plugins/mods** - Remove or update outdated ones
3. **Optimize world** - Clear unused chunks, limit entity spawning
4. **Adjust settings** - Lower view distance, optimize tick rate
5. **Upgrade plan** - If resources are consistently maxed out

### High Memory Usage

1. **Check RAM usage** - Monitor in your panel
2. **Restart regularly** - Helps clear memory leaks
3. **Update plugins/mods** - Old versions can cause issues
4. **Upgrade RAM** - If you're consistently running out

## Server Crashes

### Frequent Crashes

1. **Check crash logs** - Look in console for error messages
2. **Update everything** - Server software, plugins/mods, Java version
3. **Check for conflicts** - Disable plugins/mods one by one to find the issue
4. **Check resources** - Out of memory? Upgrade your plan

### Startup Errors

1. **Check configuration** - Verify server.properties and file permissions
2. **Restore from backup** - If files are corrupted
3. **Check dependencies** - Make sure Java version is compatible
4. **Update server software** - Use the latest version
