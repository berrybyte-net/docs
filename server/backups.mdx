Backups protect your server from data loss, crashes, corruption, or accidental file changes. berrybyte also takes **daily off-site backups automatically**, giving you an extra layer of protection.

## Creating Backups

Go to the **Backups** tab in your game panel and click **Create Backup**.

You’ll see a form that lets you customize the backup:

</Frame>

### Options

- **Backup Name** — optional; leave blank for an automatic timestamp  
- **Ignored Files & Directories** — skip files/folders (e.g., `/plugins/Dynmap/*`)  
- **Locked** — prevents accidental deletion  

Click **Start Backup** to begin.

## Deleting Backups

To delete a backup:

1. Click the three dots next to the backup  
2. Select **Delete**  
3. Confirm deletion  

<Warning>Deleted backups **cannot** be recovered.</Warning>

## Restoring Backups

To restore a backup:

1. Click the three dots next to the backup

**Tip:** Always create a fresh backup before restoring, just in case you want to revert.

## Mounting Backups

If you need to restore **specific files** instead of the entire server, use **Mount Backup**.

Mounting turns a backup into a read-only folder you can browse.

<Warning>
  While a backup is mounted, you cannot use power controls (Start/Stop/Restart).  
  Unmount the backup first.
</Warning>

2. Select **Mount**  
3. A new folder will appear in your File Manager

### Restoring Files from a Mounted Backup

Open the mounted folder, select any files or folders, then choose:

- **Restore** — restores files to their original location  
- **Move** — restores files to a different folder  

---

## Off-Site Backups

We automatically take off-site backups **every 24 hours**, stored for **14 days**.  
These backups are kept on remote storage and can be restored on request.

### To request an off-site backup restore:

[Create a ticket](https://berrybyte.net/ticket) with:

- Your **server ID** (Settings → Debug Information)  
- Your **email address**  
- The **date** of the backup you want  

<Warning>
  Make your own backup before we restore an off-site snapshot -  
  off-site restores overwrite your current server and cannot be undone.
</Warning>
