## Choosing the Right Region

For the best performance, choose the region closest to you or your players.

berrybyte currently offers these regions:

- **US West (Seattle, WA)**
- **US East (Ashburn, VA)**
- **US Central (Dallas, TX)**
- **EU Central (Germany)**
- **EU West (London, UK)**
- **Asia (Singapore)**

<Info>Closer region = lower ping and smoother gameplay.</Info>

## Where to See Your Region

Your server’s region is shown in your panel under **Settings** and **Debug Information**.

---

## Changing Your Region

You can move your server between our server regions at any time.

If you need to move your server to a different region, open a [support ticket](https://berrybyte.net/support) and we’ll migrate your files for you.

<Warning>Your server will be unavailable during the migration and can take up to 30 minutes.</Warning>

## Quick Tips

- If most of your players are in the US → pick the nearest US region  
- If you’re hosting for EU players → Germany or London  
- If you're in Asia/Oceania → Singapore  
- One person lagging usually isn’t a region issue  
- Mods, plugins, or low RAM can also cause lag
