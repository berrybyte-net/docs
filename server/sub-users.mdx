The new user will receive login credentials via email. If they don't get the email, they can use the **Forgot Password** option to set their password.

## Managing Sub-Users

- **Change permissions**: Edit their user settings anytime
- **Revoke access**: Remove them from your server when needed
- **View activity**: Check the **Activity** tab to see what they've done on the panel
