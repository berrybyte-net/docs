## SFTP Upload

<Info>No size limit. Recommended for large files.</Info>

Use SFTP if you’re uploading **worlds**, **modpacks**, or files larger than 100MB.

### Recommended SFTP Clients

- **[Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io/)** — Simple UI, Windows & macOS  
- **[WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/download.php)** — Windows-only  
- **[Termius](https://termius.com/)** — Advanced, cross-platform  

### How to Connect

1. Go to **Settings** → **Launch SFTP**  
2. Copy your SFTP details  
3. Open Cyberduck (or another client)  
4. Choose **Open Connection → SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol)**  
5. Enter your credentials  
6. Drag-and-drop your files into the server

**Slow transfer?**  
Lots of small files upload slowly.  
Zip them first, upload once, and then [unarchive](/panel/unarchiving) them in the panel.
