The berrybyte dashboard includes simple controls that let you start, stop, and restart your server at any time. 
These actions are essential when applying changes, fixing issues, or performing maintenance.

## Where to Find the Controls

You’ll see the **Start**, **Stop**, and **Restart** buttons at the top of your server dashboard.

## Start Your Server

Click **Start** to turn on your server.

Use this when:

- You installed new files and want to test them  

After clicking Start, allow **1–3 minutes** for the server to fully boot.

Stopping:

- Saves worlds, maps, and data  
- Closes all active connections  
- Prevents file corruption  
- Allows large file uploads safely
