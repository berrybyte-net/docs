If you or other players can’t connect to your server, don’t worry, most issues are easy to fix. This guide covers the most common reasons a server becomes unreachable and how to solve them quickly.

---

## Is Your Server Running?

<Info>Your server must be **online** before anyone can join.</Info>

Check the top of your panel:

- **Running** → OK  
- **Starting** → wait 1–3 minutes  
- **Stopping** → wait for shutdown  
- **Offline** → click **Start**  

If your server is stuck on **Starting**, check your latest logs.

---

## Check Your Server IP & Port

Make sure you’re using the correct:

- **IP Address**  
- **Port**  
- **Connection Address** shown in your panel

</Frame>

<Warning>Copy/paste exactly as shown — even one wrong number will prevent joining.</Warning>

## Restart Your Server

Restarting fixes:

- Port binding issues  
- Temporary crashes  
- Cached mods/plugins  
- Stuck processes  

Click **Restart** and try again.

---

## Incorrect Game Version

The most common reason players can’t join.

Check that:

- Your server is on the **same version** as your game client  
- Mods/plugins match the version  
- You didn’t accidentally update your game but not your server  

<Info>If your game auto-updated, update your server too.</Info>

---

## Mods / Plugins Causing Crashes

If you recently added mods, plugins, or resource packs:

- Stop your server  
- Remove the most recent additions  
- Start again  
- Check your logs for errors  

A bad mod/plugin can break the startup process and block connections.

---

## Network / Firewall Restrictions

Some networks block game traffic:

- School WiFi  
- Work networks  
- Public hotspots  
- Parental controls  
- VPN conflicts  

Try:

- Using mobile hotspot  
- Disabling VPN  
- Switching networks  

If your players can connect but **you** can’t → this is the cause.

## Server Is Still Starting Up

Heavy modpacks or large worlds may take **longer to boot**.

Wait 2–5 minutes if you see:

- "Preparing spawn"  
- "Loading world"  
- "Starting server"  
- "Loading mods"  

Avoid spamming **Start** — it may interrupt loading.

---

## Resource Limits Reached

If your RAM or CPU is maxed out, your server may become unreachable.

Check your **Resource Usage** tab:

- RAM pinned at 100% → add more or remove mods  
- CPU spikes → restart or optimize  
- Disk usage full → delete logs or old worlds  

---

## Your Server Was Updated / Restarted Automatically

If you recently installed:

- New version  
- New mods/plugins  
- New world  

You must restart your server to apply changes.

---

## Still Can't Connect?

If none of the above solved it, include this info when contacting support:

- Your **server ID**  
- The **IP + Port** you’re using  
- A screenshot of your **logs**  
- What changed before the issue began
